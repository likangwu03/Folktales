Your task is to identify the minimum set of essential for the story to make sense (e.g., Cinderella's glass slipper). An object is any entity that is neither a character nor a place, but that plays a significant role in the story.
                                            
DO NOT extract:
- Humans or human-like characters.
- Anthropomorphic animals (animals that speak, reason or behave like humans).
- Locations, places, settings or environments (e.g., castles, forests, villages). 

Each object MUST include:
- Exactly one 'class_name' chosen from the allowed list.
- One appropriate 'instance_name', that describes the object.

ALLOWED 'class_name' VALUES:
- {objects}
                  
HIERARCHY (FOR REASONING):
{object_hierarchy}
                           
CLASS SELECTION RULES:
1. ALWAYS choose the MOST SPECIFIC class available.
   - Example: If the location is a glass slipper, use 'crafted_object' rather than 'inanimate_object'.
   - Example: If the location is an apple, use 'natural_obejct' rather than 'inanimate_object'.

2. Each object MUST have exactly ONE 'class_name'.
   - Do NOT combine multiple classes.
   - Do NOT repeat fields.
                          
INSTANCE NAME RULES:
- 'instance_name' must be written in snake_case.
- Use lowercase letters and underscores only.
- Be descriptive but concise.
- Do NOT include spaces, hyphens, or punctuation.
- Examples: 'glass_slipper', 'ball_gown', 'oak_tree'.
