At last one day he saw birds in the trees and he knew that he was near the border of the Hunger-Land. That night in the forest when he stopped at a stream to drink, he saw a tiny gleam of light far ahead of him through the trees. He hurried towards the light and soon he came upon a man with a great hump on his shoulders and scars on his face, and a light hanging at his back, with a shade on it which he could close and open at his will.The Spider Man said, “I am looking for food; tell me where I can find it.”And the humped man with the light said, “Do you want it for your people?”But the Spider Man said, “No, I want it for myself.”Then the humped man laughed and said, “You are near to the border of the Land of Plenty; follow me and I will give you food.” Then he flashed the light at his back, opening and closing the shade so that the light flickered, and he set off quickly through the trees.The Spider Man followed the light flashing in the darkness, but he had to go so fast that he was almost out of breath when he reached the house where the humped man had stopped. But the humped man only laughed when he saw the Spider Man coming puffing wearily along with his fat and swollen belly. He gave him a good fat meal and the Spider Man soon felt better after his long journey. He ate until he was full, and then asked the humped man for more food, but the humped man said that he had only given him this one meal, and that he would have to find food on his own from now on. The Spider Man thanked the humped man and set off once again in search of food, but he did not know where to go or how to find it. He wandered through the forest for many days, but he could not find any food, and he began to grow weak and hungry. At last he came upon a clearing and saw four pots sitting there. The humped man had given them to him earlier, and he knew that they would give him all the food he needed if he only used them correctly. But the Spider Man was too greedy and impatient, and he opened the pots before he reached his home, thinking that he could eat the food right away. And so, when he arrived at his home, he found that the pots were empty, and that there was no food to be had. He was very disappointed and angry, and he did not know what to do. He thought about going back to the humped man and asking him for more food, but he was too proud to do so. And so, he decided to invite all his people to a feast, thinking that they would be impressed by his generosity and kindness. But when he went to get the pots, he found that they were empty, and that there was no food to be had. He was very disappointed and angry, and he did not know what to do. The people gathered for the feast, but when the Spider Man brought out the pots, they were empty, and there was no food to be had. They were all amazed and disappointed, and they fell upon the Spider Man in anger and rage. He tried to defend himself, but it was too late, and he was beaten and torn apart by the people. The humped man stood by and watched, laughing and smiling at the sight of the Spider Man's downfall. And so, the Spider Man lived out his days as a creature with eight legs and a fat round belly, eating only flies and insects, and trying to climb up the strand of yarn he had spun, but always falling back down again.",
