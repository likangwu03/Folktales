He encounters three birds - a wood-pigeon, a wild duck, and a stork - each of whom owes him a debt for saving their lives in the past. The first bird helps him sort wheat and barley, the second finds a lost ring, and the third produces a baby who can speak all languages and play musical instruments. The prince is eventually recognized as a true prince and marries the king's daughter. The two soldiers who had plotted against him are punished for their envy.",
